## 🎸 About This Project

This is a personal landing page with major vaporwave/synthwave vibes. The site features a rad animated gradient background, glowing elements, and minimalist content that gets right to the point.

## ✨ Features

* Animated gradient background to mesmerize babies
* Retro grid overlay reminiscent of the 80s when parents could let kids play outside unsupervised
* Glowing profile image with pulse animation, like how my heart glows when my kid says "Good night!" (Because it's super cute and also now I can go play on the computer)
* Social links to connect with other coding parents in the wild

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3 (with animations that are more reliable than toddler nap schedules)
* No JavaScript (because parents don't have time for that extra complexity)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibecodemama/vibecodemama.github.io
```

2. Open index.html in your browser of choice
```bash
cd landing-page
open index.html  # For Mac
# or
start index.html  # For Windows
```

3. Marvel at the colors while your kids ask what you're doing

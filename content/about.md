I'm a stay-at-home mom with an almost 3-year-old who's already learning to build software using AI tools. I believe in the power of systems over goals, the magic of automation for creating good habits, and that beautiful software should make you feel happyâ€”just like walking into a well-designed home.

This is where I share our discoveries, the systems that keep our family running smoothly, and the magic of raising both children and pixels in an age where AI makes the impossible feel possible.
